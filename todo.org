   New instruction set:
   - Move/Modify (mm)
     Move then modify the cell moved to
   - Loop
   - input/output
   - Move/Set
     Set the value of the cell directly

   All instructions can take an offset field. This is relative to the
   start of the loop. Move/Modify instructions can be reordered inbetween
   input/output and loops.

   Detecting certain loops:
   - Loops that only modify always end on zero. Can be replaced with set to zero
     instruction. Very often =[-]=
   - Multiplication loops: Loops that only move/modify and end with zero relative
     movement are multiplications. The amount added to the other cells per loop
     can instead be multiplied by =-z / n= where =z= is the number in the zeroth
     cell and =n= is the amount it is changed by (usually -1, which would equal
     multiplying each cell with =z=)

   Relative movement:
   - Relative movement is how many cells the data pointer has moved after a given
     sequence of instructions. Relative movement is separate from offset, and
     there are different rules for combining them. Determining the relative
     movement of parts of the program will help in optimization.
   - The relative movement of instructions is determined from the base sequence of
     instructions before reordering. Each instruction is assigned a relative
     movement thus:
     - Move instructions have relative movement equal to their offset minus the
       offset of the previous instruction, or just their offset if the previous
       instruction defines the base index.
     - Input/output has zero relative movement
     - Loops have undefined relative movement as a base assumption. This means that
       the base index must be defined at the start and end of a loop.
   - The relative movement of loops can be detected in certain circumstances:
     - The loop sequence instructions must all have defined relative movements.
     - The relative movement of the loop sequence must sum to zero, *OR* the
       number of loop iterations must be known.
   - If the relative movement of a loop becomes known the

   Using relative movement:
   - Modify instructions can directly modify [base + rel] instead of updating the
     base index for every modification.
   - Similarly input and output can read/write directly to [base + rel].

*** DONE [#A] Fix IR concatenation, it does not take advantage of invariants
    An IR sequence should always be minimal, so concatenating two
    sequences should only have to look at the two middle elements, not
    recurse on either sequence.
*** TODO Modify and move can be merged to a single instruction
*** TODO Set instead of modify when cell value is known
*** TODO Cell offset when we have a known cell index
** IN-PROGRESS Static analysis
*** DONE Dead code elimination
    CLOSED: [2019-06-17 ma. 22:22]
**** DONE Dead loops (known zero cell at start)
     - Start of program
     - Immediately after another loop
**** TODO Useless code at end of program
     Anything after the last IO operation is pointless
** Get rid of excess loads and stores?
   By keeping a map from offsets to operands maybe extraneous loads can be
   avoided. Setting base index prompts a store of the map, and discards the map.
   Something to investigate at least.
* [#C] Interpreter improvements
** Design for external manipulation
   Current design works for running a program from start to finish.
   A debugger would want to update the program underway (costly
   updates is ok).

* [#C] Debugger
** TODO Debugging UI
*** Proposed design:
    - Split screen top/bottom, instructions displayed on top, data on
      bottom. Ex:

      Current instruction
      |
      {<-}  -->--]> v >>[+++.] {->}
      >>++.[<+++>-](-)---[>,+++++<]
      00 00 00 02 (f3) a2 92 00 00
      00 00 00 00  ^   00 00 00 00
      00 00 00 00  |   00 00 00 00
      Current data

      The instructions are displayed as if on a "tape" being fed in
      from the top left corner and going out the top right corner.
      The current instruction is in the "read" position in the middle
      of the screen, right above the "read" position of the data
      tape. The next instructions continue on the right until they
      reach the edge of the screen, then they wrap to the middle of
      the screen on the line above. They continue until the end of the
      instructions or they reach the top right corner. The
      instructions prior to the current flow similarly, but to the
      left instead. With @n being a portal to the other @n, the flow
      looks like:

      >  >  >  >@1 @4>  >  >  >
      @1>  >  >  >@2 @3>  >  >  >@4
      @2>  >  >  > (%) >  >  >  >@3

      Data flows similarly, but on the bottom half of the screen.

** TODO [#C] Requires new interpreter:
*** TODO Moving data pointer and instruction pointer forwards and backwards
*** TODO Live-editing instructions
*** TODO Time-traveling debugger
* Optimize the actual compiler
** DONE Something is making the compiler take a lot of time with the new IR.
   CLOSED: [2019-06-20 to. 12:11]
*** =named= causes quadratic behaviour when the same name is used a lot.
